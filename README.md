# Smart Stock AI

Smart Stock is a stock exchange web app where you can buy and sell stocks.

# Future development plans:
Premium users will have access to an AI that provides predictions for stock prices.

Deep learning will be used to train the AI to understand time series data for prediction.

To develop the deep learning model, recurrent neural networks (RNN) with either LSTM, GRU, or transformers will be used.
